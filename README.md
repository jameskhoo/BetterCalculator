# BetterCalculator
This is Programming Exercise 1 for Developing iOS 8 App with Swift from Stanford University

I modified the original calculator code, to make the calculator more *natural* and follow the math order of operations, for example:

* 2 * 3 + 4 * 2 = 6 + 8 = 14
* 6 / 2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

I have limited understanding of iOS Autolayout, hence the current code will only work in vertical mode.
